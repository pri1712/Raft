// The labrpc package simulates a lossy network, in which servers
// may be unreachable, and in which requests and replies may be lost.

// can't be reached, a lost request, or a lost reply.

// Call() is guaranteed to return (perhaps after a delay) *except* if the
// handler function on the server side does not return.Thus, there
// is no need to implement your own timeouts around Call().
